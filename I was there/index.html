      I was digging through an old wallet and found a faded ticket to a show I went to over a decade ago. <br>
      So I goggled the show, and like everything else for the past ten years, it was online. Almost no views, <br>
      the sound washed out worse than my memory of that night. The video functions like a digital souvenir <br>
      mailed by someone I can barely remember. A flip phone in the front row? Must have been. Maybe I don't remember him <br>
      at all. <br>
      And yet, <br>
      We were there. <br>
