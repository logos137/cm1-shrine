      I was digging through an old wallet and found a faded ticket to a show I went to over a decade ago.
      So I goggled the show, and like everything else for the past ten years, it was online. Almost no views,
      the sound washed out worse than my memory of that night. The video functions like a digital souvenir
      mailed by someone I can barely remember. A flip phone in the front row? Must have been. Maybe I don't remember him
      at all.
      But, 
      We were there.
